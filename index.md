### ABOUT THE VMI 

The [Vanderbilt Microbiome Initiative (VMI)](https://lab.vanderbilt.edu/microbiome/) brings together an unprecedented group of multidisciplinary expertise from six schools in the university to: (i) create an infrastructure that unifies the microbiome community around complex challenges, (ii) catalyze campus-wide research, training, and teaching activities, and (iii) deploy state-of-the-science technologies and methods that will fundamentally advance microbiome science, therapy, education, and policy.

From bacteria to archaea, viruses, and single-celled eukaryotes, communities of microbes have major impacts on our health, our homes, our genomes, the oceans, atmosphere, and biodiversity. The Vanderbilt Microbiome Initiative is producing research, education, and outreach that will improve basic, translational, and clinical science, spur new aspects of law and and philosophy, and expose a microbial world astonishing in its universality and diversity.

### What To Expect From This Boot Camp

- First, we will begin by using the command line to interact with [Qiime2](https://qiime2.org/) (_pronounced "chime"_), a bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing microbiome data. Don't worry if you've never used it before, we will walk you through each step during the boot camp and you will be able to copy and paste along with us from this very GitHub page. You can learn more about the basics of command line [here](https://youtu.be/5XgBd6rjuDQ) if you're on a Mac and [here](https://youtu.be/MBBWVgE0ewk) if you're on a computer running Windows.

Here's what that will look like when we encounter code together during the boot camp:

This is code that you can copy and paste right in your command line during the boot camp 

```

- After we process our microbiome data in Qiime2, we will jump over to [MicrobiomeAnalyst](https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca), a web-based microbiome analysis tool, to upload our processed data and further analyze and visualize our microbiome data. MicrobiomeAnalyst is a graphical user interface aka GUI (_pronouced "gooey"_) which means we will be point and click for this portion of the boot camp.  

- Along the way we will be talking all about the microbiome, what it is, where to find it, how to sample it, when to use which test, and how to make sense of it all. If you can't wait to dig in, learn about major milestones in the study of the [microbiome](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-019-00041-z/index.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=mile-humanmicrobiotaresearchintgutbrainaxis) as curated by the scientific journal, _Nature_. 

- If you want to learn more about microbiome analysis now, including the metrics we use to evaluate microbiomes such as [alpha and beta diversity](https://youtu.be/CQaFT_vVQvw), watch this video from the VMI for a gentle introduction.

### What To Do Before The Boot Camp

1) The main thing we need to do to be prepared for the boot camp is [install Qiime on a Mac](https://youtu.be/1vRQ2MPRRpo) or [install Qiime on a Windows PC](https://youtu.be/b4l_wIJ1dwE) and make sure it runs! 

**If you're not able to get Qiime2 running then make an zoom appointment with the [VMI team](mailto:robert.h.markowitz@vanderbilt.edu) and we'll try to trouble shoot it along with you. We have availability every Monday and Friday from 12PM-1PM until the 26th.**

2) At 9AM CST on Friday, February 26th this page will magically update so all you have to do is return here in the morning and you will find all of the content for the boot camp and an zoom invite in your inbox to attend the boot camp.

### That's all for now, microbe hunters! We'll see you soon!
